# UnityGitSync
## What is it?
UnityGitSync is a simple and intuitive desktop application that lets casual programmers quickly upload their code to GitHub.
## Why does it exist?
I have found many students in my GameDev classes struggling to save their projects online so they can work on it at home. Often times they have to zip this huge project and use Google Drive or Gmail, which is not fun. This is also a good way to introduce those students into the world of Git and GitHub!
